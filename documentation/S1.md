## 1. Overview about vscode,Emmet,VS code extensions,Fontawsome,Favicon,Colourhunt,mdn,google fonts,Starter app

1. **VS Code:** It is a powerful code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows ,macOS and linux  and it is free also
2. **Emmet:** Emmet is a powerful toolkit for web developers that allows for faster HTML and CSS workflow. It is a built in feature  in VS code.
3. **VS code extensions:** VS Code extensions are add-ons that enhance the functionality of the Visual Studio Code editor.These extensions can add new features, improve existing ones, or provide tools for specific programming languages.
4. **Fontawsome:** Fontawsome is the most popular way to icons to your website.
5. **Favicon:** A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small image or icon associated with a website or webpage. It typically appears in the browser's address bar near title bar.
6. **Colourhunt:** Colour Hunt is a platform and community for discovering and sharing color palettes. It's a valuable resource for designers and developers.
7. **mdn:** MDN Web Docs, formerly known as the Mozilla Developer Network, is a comprehensive resource for web developers. It provides documentation, tutorials, and guides covering various web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
8. **google fonts:** Google Fonts is a free and open-source platform provided by Google that allows users to browse, select, and use a wide variety of fonts for their web projects.
9. **Starter app:** Creating a starter app, also known as a template, can be beneficial for several reasons.
    * It saves developers time and effort by eliminating the need to recreate the same basic structure for each new project. Instead, they can start with a pre-configured setup and focus on building unique features.
    * Using a starter app ensures consistency across projects
    * It establishes common practices, file structures and coding conventions, that promote uniformity within a team or across multiple projects.

## 2. Overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

* **HTML** is the foundation of web development. It defines the structure and content of web pages using markup tags. HTML tags are used to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.
  
* **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style HTML elements and define their appearance on the web page. It allows developers to control aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS can be written inline, embedded within HTML, or in external style sheets.
  
* **JavaScript** is a versatile programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables features like form validation, animations and more. Like CSS JavaScript can be embedded within HTML, or in external JavaScript file.
